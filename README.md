# DevSecOps SDLC

## Project Description:

Welcome to the DevSecOps SDLC Project! This GitHub repository serves as the central hub for managing our software development lifecycle with a strong emphasis on security. Our goal is to integrate security seamlessly into every phase of the development process, ensuring that our software is not only functional but also resilient against potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## Key Objectives:

1. Shift-Left Security: We believe in addressing security concerns from the very beginning. This means that security is not an afterthought but an integral part of our development process. Our code is secure by design.

2. Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD): We've established a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes while incorporating security checks at each stage. This enables us to deliver high-quality, secure software quickly.

3. Automated Security Testing: Our project includes automated security testing tools that scan code for vulnerabilities, assess the configuration of our infrastructure, and identify potential threats. We regularly update and expand these tools to keep up with emerging risks.

4. Security as Code: We treat security policies, configurations, and compliance checks as code. This allows us to version control and automate these aspects, ensuring consistent and auditable security measures.

5. Continuous Monitoring: Our project incorporates continuous monitoring tools to keep an eye on our applications and infrastructure in production. This enables us to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time.
